# Machine-Learning-For-IR
Using Weka (Decision Trees Model) trained a corpus of 20000 documents

Predicted labels for 5000 documents with higher precision i.e. accuracy of retrieval

Created a .arff file format for storing 7 feature values for every document including okapi, okapibm25, unigram lm with laplace smoothing, unigram LM with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing, document lengths, tf-idf and query term frequency values of every document.
